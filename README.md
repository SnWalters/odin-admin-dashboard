# odin-admin-dashboard

In this project, I will be making an admin dashboard.

I will be using grid for the initial layout, and for the cards, then flex
for pretty much everything else.

The left side of the screen will have a bunch of links, with the logo
at the top. 

The header will have a search bar, notifications bell, username, and
a few other links.

The main area, will have different 'cards', the main part of which will be
set up using grid, then the right side will have 2 more 'cards', which will
most likely be set up using flex.

I will be using quite a bit of icons, likely from fontawesome, or something
similar.
